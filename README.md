## Grafana and Copilot Metrics Dashboard

This is a personal project where I've developed a sample dashboard in Grafana Cloud to help teams and companies visualise GitHub copilot metrics within Grafana via the [Copilot API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28). Feel free to make suggestions in the Issues tab and get in contact via [Contact Info](#contact-info)

TLDR; I queried the json response from the Copilot API endpoint and used Grafana to massage the data.

As the Copilot endpoint data is only relevant for 28 days. You can use [Recorded Queries](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/recorded-queries/) to store the API response in the Grafana Cloud hosted prometheus.

## How to get started with creating your dashboard!

### GitHub 
Login and create a [Personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) that will match the permission requirements for the [GitHub Copilot API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-enterprise-members)
- [Click here for Enterprises Copilot API Endpoints requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-enterprise-members)
- [Click here for Organisation Copilot API Endpoints requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-organization-members)

Save the secret and don't expose it!

### Grafana

- Rename your data source name to whatever you like. Ideally 'GitHub Copilot'

- Click on the default flag to turn it on(optional)
- Go to the Authentication tab and paste your GitHub token in Bearer Token
- Add 'https://api.github.com' as allowed hosts
- Click Save and Test
- Open copilotsample.json file and replace all occurences of `your-org` and `your-enterprise` with your GitHub organisation and enterprise name
- Navigate to the left hand menu ---> Dashboards ---> New ----> Import
- Paste the contents of copilotsample.json into the screen. Alternatively, upload the whole file
- Select the Data source you created earlier
- VOILA! Your dashboard is here

**Note:** If you haven't updated `your-org` and `your-enterprise` with your GitHub organisation and enterprise name earlier, you'll need to change the URL of each panel to the relevant API endpoints above. Do this by going to the top right hand corner of each Panel --> Edit --> change URL... or follow the instructions under the JSON template edit subheading
