## Grafana and Copilot Metrics Dashboard

This is a personal project where I've developed a sample dashboard in Grafana Cloud to help teams and companies visualise GitHub copilot metrics within Grafana via the [Copilot API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28). Feel free to make suggestions in the Issues tab and get in contact via [Contact Info](#contact-info)

TLDR; I queried the json response from the Copilot API endpoint and used Grafana to massage the data.

As the Copilot endpoint data is only relevant for 28 days. You can use [Recorded Queries](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/recorded-queries/) to store the API response in the Grafana Cloud hosted prometheus.

## How to get started with creating your dashboard!

### GitHub 
Login and create a [Personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) that will match the permission requirements for the [GitHub Copilot API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-enterprise-members)
- [Click here for Enterprises Copilot API Endpoints requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-enterprise-members)
- [Click here for Organisation Copilot API Endpoints requirements](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-organization-members)

Save the secret and don't expose it!

- Rename your data source name to whatever you like. Ideally 'GitHub Copilot'

- Click on the default flag to turn it on(optional)
- Go to the Authentication tab and paste your GitHub token in Bearer Token
- Add 'https://api.github.com' as allowed hosts
- Click Save and Test
- Navigate to the left hand menu ---> Dashboards ---> New ----> Import ----> Paste/Upload the copilotsample.json contents into the screen
- Select the Data source you created earlier
- VOILA! Your dashboard is here

**Note:** You'll need to change the URL of each panel to the specified API endpoints above. Do this by going to the top right hand corner of each Panel --> Edit --> change URL... or follow the instructions under the JSON template edit subheading

### Json template edits
The current .json file contains the template of the dashboard. It uses test sample data(same as the GitHub API response) which I've exported into a .json file which is located in the dummydata folder. 
The following lines of code are the ones that need to be changed in the .json file to your Enterprise/Organisation API Endpoint

Change the URL's in the following lines to your [Organisation API Endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
```
162
413
```
Change the URL's in the following lines to your [Enterprise API Endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-summary-of-copilot-usage-for-enterprise-members)
```
254
536
685
831
998
1170
1290
```


### CoPilot Templates with GitHub API URLs
Just import CopilotTemplate.json and set defaults for the variables:
- enterpriseName
- orgName
